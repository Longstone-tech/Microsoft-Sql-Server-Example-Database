Hello;

I shared the file in Google Drive because of its large size.

After installing Microsoft Sql Server and Microsoft Sql Server Management Studio, you can download and open these files from the Drive area.

This sample database, which is prepared by using keys such as Primary Key, Unique Key and sticking to the normalization data, will be very useful for you.

Best Regards,
